# freeCodeCamp Survey Form Project (Responsive Web Design)

This is the first project in the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course, the objective of this project is to use html and css to create 
a simple survey to demonstrate a basic understanding of html and css principles.

## Objectives
-Create a basic html boilerplate
-Create a form to gather information
-Style the html with css 

## Reflection 
Although this was a simple project using simple html and css elements this was a challenge for me to complete. The most difficult part of the project 
was styling the html with css, specifically the radio and checkbox input elements. The elements would not align until outside resources were consulted 
mainly W3schools and MDN Web Docs to find a solution to the issue. Overall, this was a great project to identify weak points in my understanding and 
allowed me to practice those areas.
